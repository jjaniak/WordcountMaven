# WordCounter program 
***
##### Description:
This Java program is supposed to take an input from a user. 
It can be either a string typed by the user or a text file for which it is necessary to provide a file path.

Once the input is provided the program should analyze its content and return four values:
- number of **_spaces_**
- number of **_special characters_** (_special character_ is anything that is not a letter of Latin alphabet, digit or a whitespace character)
- number of **_numbers_** (_number_ is one or more digits surrounded by some whitespace characters.)
- number of **_words_** (_word_ is one or more letters surrounded by some whitespace characters. It may end with one of the following characters:  . , ? !)

 The application can be ended by typing *end*.
